# Keep2Org

Convert Google Keep notes to Emacs .org files

Usage:
`python k2o.py /path/to/google/Keep/folder /path/to/org/file.org`

Given a Takeout of your Google Keep Notes in .html format, output .org files with logical groupings
based on tags. This will also format lists and try to be smart.

Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to download your Keep data. Extract the data and run this script on it.
